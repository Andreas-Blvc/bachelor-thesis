Motion planning is an essential aspect of robotics and autonomous systems, requiring algorithms that efficiently generate safe and feasible
trajectories.
This thesis examines motion planning for autonomous vehicles by formulating it as an optimization problem that considers safety, efficiency, and
computational feasibility.
A primary focus is on real- time planning in dynamic environments, where vehicles must navigate while accounting for constraints such as road
boundaries, vehicle dynamics, and interactions with other agents.

To address this, we develop optimization-based motion planning approaches using both the point mass and bicycle models.
The methodology transforms the motion planning problem into a convex optimization framework, facilitating the efficient computation of feasible
trajectories.
Techniques such as convex relaxation and quantifier elimination are employed to improve solution robustness and computational efficiency.
The proposed approach is evaluated through simulations to assess its performance.

The results indicate that the framework can generate feasible and efficient trajectories while maintaining computational efficiency.
The evaluation demonstrates its applicability across various planning scenarios, supporting its potential use in autonomous driving applications.
