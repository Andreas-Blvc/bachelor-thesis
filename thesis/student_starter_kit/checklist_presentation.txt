Organization:
- design your presentation according to your audience
- motivate your topic in the first slides
- guide the audience verbally through the sections (i.e. make smooth transitions)
- do not include an overview/table of content for short presentations (<30min)
- practise your talk several times, so that you can talk freely and adhere to the time limit

Content:
- only present the main points of your work and exclude the others
- clearly introduce your problem statement
- avoid equations and math symbols as much as possible
- provide figures as illustrative support
- show the most interesting results of your numerical experiments, if applicable
- have at most as many slides as minutes your presentation should be long
- summarize your main points on the last side and highlight what the approach is good for
- do not write "thank you" on the last slide

Delivery (presence and verbal skills):
- do not look at the projection screen or your laptop, but into the audience!
- speak clear, slowly, and loud enough

Design of slides:
- put only few text on each slide
- do not just read the text from your slides, but explain them (verbally)
- use (many) informative figures
- in figures, label all objects (including axis)
- use large enough font size

Discussion:
- ask yourself, which questions could arise after my presentation, and prepare answers for those

Citations:
- put references on the same slide where they occur (and not all together on the last slide); as an example, see the template
