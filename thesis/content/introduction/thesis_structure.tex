\section{Thesis Structure} \label{sec:thesis_structure}
This thesis is organized into six chapters.
Chapter 2 introduces the fundamental concepts necessary for the methodology, including convex discrete-time optimization and vehicle modeling
approaches such as the point mass and bicycle models.
Chapter 3 presents the proposed motion planning methods, detailing coordinate transformations, constraint formulations, model dynamics
approximations, and convex relaxation techniques.
It also explores various modeling strategies, including soft constraints and auxiliary variables.
Chapter 4 focuses on the implementation and evaluation of the proposed methods, describing performance analysis, simulation results, and challenges.
Chapter 5 discusses the findings, their implications, and possible improvements, outlining future research directions.
Finally, Chapter 6 concludes the thesis by summarizing its key contributions and highlighting the broader impact of the research.
