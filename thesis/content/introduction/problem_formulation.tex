\section{Problem Formulation} \label{sec:problem_formulation}

The goal of motion planning is to compute a feasible and optimal trajectory for an autonomous vehicle that safely navigates from an initial state to
a goal region while satisfying dynamic and environmental constraints.
Using an optimization-based approach, this problem can be formulated as finding a function $\pi(t): [0,T] \to \mathcal{X}$,where $\mathcal{X}$ is the
configuration space representing all feasible vehicle states, and $T$ is the planning horizon.

The vehicle starts at an initial configuration $x_{\text{initial}} \in \mathcal{X}$, and must reach a goal region $X_{\text{goal}} \subset
	\mathcal{X}$ within the time horizon T .
The trajectory must also satisfy constraints on its derivatives, such as velocity, acceleration, and higher-order dynamics, which are represented by
a predicate $D(\pi(t), \pi'(t), \pi''(t), \dots)$.

To formulate this as an optimization problem, we define an objective function $J(\pi): \Pi[\mathcal{X}, T] \to \mathbb{R}$ that evaluates the quality
of a given trajectory $\pi(t)$ over the planning horizon.
This function may incorporate metrics such as smoothness, energy efficiency, safety, or time minimization.

\subsubsection{Problem Definition: Optimal Trajectory Planning} \label{subsec:optimal_trajectory_planning}

Given a 6-tuple $(\mathcal{X}, x_{\text{initial}}, X_{\text{goal}}, D, J, T)$, the task is to find:

\begin{align}
	x^* & = \underset{\pi \in \Pi(\mathcal{X},T)}{\operatorname{arg\,min}}
	J(\pi)                                                                                                                        \\ \text{s.t.
	}   & \quad \pi(0) = x_{\text{initial}}                                                                                       \\
	    & \quad \pi(T) \in X_{\text{goal}}                                                                                        \\
	    & \quad \pi(t) \in \mathcal{X},                                    & \text{for all} \quad t \in [0,T]                     \\
	    & \quad D(\pi(t), \pi'(t), \pi''(t), \dots),                       & \text{for all} \quad t \in [0,T] \label{eq:dynamics}
\end{align}

This formulation ensures that the computed trajectory is feasible, adheres to the vehicle's dynamic constraints, and optimizes a desired cost
function.
The next sections will discuss methods for solving this problem efficiently using numerical optimization techniques.
