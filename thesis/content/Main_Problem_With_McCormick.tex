\chapter{Main Problem with Mccormick}

The useual way how I apply McCormick is by saying:

Given a State, which is valid, find the next State which is valid with the
corresponding control which is also valid under a given Objective.

Problem: This is not convex.

By Convexifying this Relationship, we decouble the interaction.

Question:

Can this approach result in two states, where no valid control input can exist?
If so, how often does this happen.

Lets look at a example:

\[ x_{n+1} = x_{n} + u_{n} v_{n} \]

With State $x$ and Control Inputs $u$, $v$.

Applying Mccormick:

$w=xy$

Hesse-Matrix of $f(x,y)=xy$:

\[
	\nabla f = \begin{bmatrix}
		y \\
		x \\
	\end{bmatrix}
\]

\[
	\nabla^2 f = \begin{bmatrix}
		0 & 1 \\
		1 & 0 \\
	\end{bmatrix}
\]

\[
	\vert \begin{bmatrix}
		-\lambda & 1        \\
		1        & -\lambda \\
	\end{bmatrix} \vert = \lambda^2-1 = 0 \implies \lambda=\pm1
\]
