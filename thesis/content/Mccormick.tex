\chapter{McCormick Relaxation}

To illustrate the application of these relaxations in practice, consider a path-planning scenario with \( v_{min} = 1 \), \( v_{max} = 4 \), and \(
v_{start} = 1 \).
In this scenario, the bilinear term \( v\xi \), which appears in the equation of motion for \(\dot{n} = v \sin{\xi} \approx v\xi\), is approximated
using McCormick relaxations.

Figure \ref{fig:velocity} shows the planned velocity profile, which quickly reaches its upper limit.

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:alignment-error} depicts the alignment error \( \xi \) at each planned time point.
Here, \( \xi \) is bounded within \(-45^{\circ} \leq \xi \leq 45^{\circ} \).
It is noteworthy that \( \xi \) does not reach these bounds.

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:dn-term-approx} compares the actual bilinear value \( v\xi \) with the relaxation variable \( w \) introduced via McCormick
envelopes.
This comparison highlights the accuracy of the relaxation approach in approximating the bilinear interaction and its effect on the state transition
of \( n \).
Once the velocity reaches its limit, the approximation becomes increasingly accurate.

Note: The x-axis does not represent time directly but instead shows discrete time points.
Here, 30 time points per second were chosen, resulting in a range from 0 to 120 for this figure, whereas the other figures range from 0 to 4.
