\chapter{Kinematic Single Track Model in Frenet Frame}

We have already introduced the kinematic single track model in which a steering angle and an orientation, which will now combine with the idea of the
previous chapter.
We want to model our state variables in the road aligned frame, which is the Frenet frame.
The states and controls variables of the kinematic single track model are defined in the global coordinate system are defined as in \ref{eq:states_kst} and \ref{eq:controls_kst}:

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
		\centering
		$x = \begin{bmatrix} p_x \\ p_y \\ \delta \\ v \\ \psi \end{bmatrix}$
		\caption{State Variables}
	\end{subfigure}
	\hfill
	\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
		\centering
		$u = \begin{bmatrix} v_{\delta} \\ a_{\text{long}} \end{bmatrix}$
		\caption{Control Inputs}
	\end{subfigure}
\end{figure}

Our goal is not model dynamics and state variables in the Frenet frame.
