	abstract = {We describe a practical path-planning algorithm for an autonomous vehicle operating in an unknown semi-structured (or unstructured) environment, where obstacles are detected online by the robot’s sensors. This work was motivated by and experimentally validated in the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge, where robotic vehicles had to autonomously navigate parking lots. The core of our approach to path planning consists of two phases. The first phase uses a variant of A* search (applied to the 3D kinematic state space of the vehicle) to obtain a kinematically feasible trajectory. The second phase then improves the quality of the solution via numeric non-linear optimization, leading to a local (and frequently global) optimum. Further, we extend our algorithm to use prior topological knowledge of the environment to guide path planning, leading to faster search and final trajectories better suited to the structure of the environment. We present experimental results from the DARPA Urban Challenge, where our robot demonstrated near-flawless performance in complex general path-planning tasks such as navigating parking lots and executing U-turns on blocked roads. We also present results on autonomous navigation of real parking lots. In those latter tasks, which are significantly more complex than the ones in the DARPA Urban Challenge, the time of a full replanning cycle of our planner is in the range of 50—300 ms.},

	abstract = {We present an approach to the problem of differentially constrained mobile robot motion planning in arbitrary cost fields. The approach is based on deterministic search in a specially discretized state space. We compute a set of elementary motions that connects each discrete state value to a set of its reachable neighbors via feasible motions. Thus, this set of motions induces a connected search graph. The motions are carefully designed to terminate at discrete states, whose dimensions include relevant state variables (e.g., position, heading, curvature, and velocity). The discrete states, and thus the motions, repeat at regular intervals, forming a lattice. We ensure that all paths in the graph encode feasible motions via the imposition of continuity constraints on state variables at graph vertices and compliance of the graph edges with a differential equation comprising the vehicle model. The resulting state lattice permits fast full configuration space cost evaluation and collision detection. Experimental results with research prototype rovers demonstrate that the planner allows us to exploit the entire envelope of vehicle maneuverability in rough terrain, while featuring real-time performance. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Trajectory planning is a significant component of autonomous vehicle system, which directly influences the automated traffic safety. In this paper, the motion prediction of other traffic participants is considered. We use Monte Carlo simulation to predict the probabilistic occupancy of the object and give a map from probability statistics to actual scenarios. The non-time-based reference trajectory can be obtained by using high-definition map and lane detection. Then model predictive control is utilized to optimize the reference trajectory according to the current state of autonomous vehicle. Different prediction horizons and coordinate transformation are adopted to optimize the planning. By doing so, the constraint conditions can be easily involved and the result is more intuitive. The probabilistic occupancy of other traffic participants are computed offline and then the obtained results are used in real-time application. Therefore, the real-time computational burden is reduced. The crash probability is put forward to verify the feasibility of real-time trajectory in safety assessment module. Two typical scenarios are analyzed: lane change on the straight road and turning at the intersection. The simulation results illustrate the efficiency of our method.},

The historic Bertha Benz Memorial Route is particularly challenging for autonomous driving. The course taken by the autonomous vehicle had a length of 103 km and covered rural roads, 23 small villages and major cities (e.g. downtown Mannheim and Heidelberg). The route posed a large variety of difficult traffic scenarios including intersections with and without traffic lights, roundabouts, and narrow passages with oncoming traffic.

Recent advances in the field of perception, planning, and decision-making for autonomous vehicles have led to great improvements in functional capabilities, with several prototypes already driving on our roads and streets. Yet challenges remain regarding guaranteed performance and safety under all driving circumstances. For instance, planning methods that provide safe and system-compliant performance in complex, cluttered environments while modeling the uncertain interaction with other traffic participants are required. Furthermore, new paradigms, such as interactive planning and end-to-end learning, open up questions regarding safety and reliability that need to be addressed. In this survey, we emphasize recent approaches for integrated perception and planning and for behavior-aware planning, many of which rely on machine learning. This raises the question of verification and safety, which we also touch upon. Finally, we discuss the state of the art and remaining challenges for managing fleets of autonomous vehicles.},

Despite its perceived utility, it has not yet been successfully applied in automotive applications. Motivated by the successful demonstrations of learning of Atari games and Go by Google DeepMind, we propose a framework for autonomous driving using deep reinforcement learning. This is of particular relevance as it is difficult to pose autonomous driving as a supervised learning problem due to strong interactions with the environment including other vehicles, pedestrians and roadworks. As it is a relatively new area of research for autonomous driving, we provide a short overview of deep reinforcement learning and then describe our proposed framework. It incorporates Recurrent Neural Networks for information integration, enabling the car to handle partially observable scenarios. It also integrates the recent work on attention models to focus on relevant information, thereby reducing the computational complexity for deployment on embedded hardware. The framework was tested in an open source 3D car racing simulator called TORCS. Our simulation results demonstrate learning of autonomous maneuvering in a scenario of complex road curvatures and simple interaction of other vehicles.},

A cost function based on a combination of obstacle and smoothness cost is optimized in each iteration. No gradient information is required for the particular optimization algorithm that we use and so general costs for which derivatives may not be available (e.g. costs corresponding to constraints and motor torques) can be included in the cost function. We demonstrate the approach both in simulation and on a mobile manipulation system for unconstrained and constrained tasks.

	abstract = {—Traditionally, autonomous cars make predictions about other drivers’ future trajectories, and plan to stay out of their way. This tends to result in defensive and opaque behaviors. Our key insight is that an autonomous car’s actions will actually affect what other cars will do in response, whether the car is aware of it or not. Our thesis is that we can leverage these responses to plan more efﬁcient and communicative behaviors. We model the interaction between an autonomous car and a human driver as a dynamical system, in which the robot’s actions have immediate consequences on the state of the car, but also on human actions. We model these consequences by approximating the human as an optimal planner, with a reward function that we acquire through Inverse Reinforcement Learning. When the robot plans with this reward function in this dynamical system, it comes up with actions that purposefully change human state: it merges in front of a human to get them to slow down or to reach its own goal faster; it blocks two lanes to get them to switch to a third lane; or it backs up slightly at an intersection to get them to proceed ﬁrst. Such behaviors arise from the optimization, without relying on hand-coded signaling strategies and without ever explicitly modeling communication. Our user study results suggest that the robot is indeed capable of eliciting desired changes in human state by planning using this dynamical system.},

Considering surrounding vehicles, two types of uncertainties occur: multiple future maneuvers are possible, and within these maneuvers the vehicle can vary from the predicted ideal maneuver path. Focusing on only one of these uncertainties can either lead to neglecting potential risks or result in overly conservative motion planning. Here, we suggest a Stochastic Model Predictive Control strategy that tackles the possibility of multiple future maneuvers of surrounding vehicles, while also considering uncertainty within the execution of these predicted maneuvers. The proposed control method is a combination of Scenario Model Predictive Control to cope with multiple predicted maneuvers of other vehicles, and Stochastic Model Predictive Control using chance-constraints to take into account vehicle deviations from the predicted maneuver trajectories of the respective maneuver. Adjustable risk parameters permit a violation of safety constraints up to a desired probability, allowing a trade-off between risk and performance. A simulation of a two-lane scenario demonstrates the effectiveness of our method.},

To provide dynamically feasible trajectory planning for vehicles based on different control goals one has to deal with the trade-off between numerical resources and correctness. The first part of the paper presents a solution which uses classical optimization based approach that generates the expected results though on the expense of computational effort, which is not acceptable in real-time environment. Two hybrid approaches are introduced in the second part, where the optimization is replaced or aided with artificial neural networks (ANN), trained with the data generated off-line by the first planner. Results show that the solution highly decreases the running time of the algorithm, with almost the same level of performance.

	abstract = {Sampling-based motion planning is one of the fundamental paradigms to generate robot motions, and a cornerstone of robotics research. This comparative review provides an up-to-date guide and reference manual for the use of sampling-based motion planning algorithms. It includes a history of motion planning, an overview of the most successful planners, and a discussion of their properties. It also shows how planners can handle special cases and how extensions of motion planning can be accommodated. To put sampling-based motion planning into a larger context, a discussion of alternative motion generation frameworks highlights their respective differences from sampling-based motion planning. Finally, a set of sampling-based motion planners are compared on 24 challenging planning problems in order to provide insights into which planners perform well in which situations and where future research would be required. This comparative review thereby provides not only a useful reference manual for researchers in the field but also a guide for practitioners to make informed algorithmic decisions.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the self-driving car technologies have been developed with many successful stories in both academia and industry. The challenge for autonomous vehicles is the requirement of operating accurately and robustly in the urban environment. This paper focuses on how to efficiently solve the hierarchical control system of a self-driving car into practice. This technique is composed of decision making, local path planning and control. An ego vehicle is navigated by global path planning with the aid of a High Definition map. Firstly, we propose the decision making for motion planning by applying a two-stage Finite State Machine to manipulate mission planning and control states. Furthermore, we implement a real-time hybrid A* algorithm with an occupancy grid map to find an efficient route for obstacle avoidance. Secondly, the local path planning is conducted to generate a safe and comfortable trajectory in unstructured scenarios. Herein, we solve an optimization problem with nonlinear constraints to optimize the sum of jerks for a smooth drive. In addition, controllers are designed by using the pure pursuit algorithm and the scheduled feedforward PI controller for lateral and longitudinal direction, respectively. The experimental results show that the proposed framework can operate efficiently in the urban scenario.},

Safety-critical tasks that must be executed by a self-driving vehicle include planning of motions through a dynamic environment shared with other vehicles and pedestrians, and their robust executions via feedback control. The objective of this paper is to survey the current state of the art on planning and control algorithms with particular regard to the urban setting. A selection of proposed techniques is reviewed along with a discussion of their effectiveness. The surveyed approaches differ in the vehicle mobility model used, in assumptions on the structure of the environment, and in computational requirements. The side by side comparison presented in this survey helps to gain insight into the strengths and limitations of the reviewed approaches and assists with system level design choices.},

Being given the predicted motion of the traffic flow, the proposed semi-reactive planning strategy realizes all required long-term maneuver tasks (lane-changing, merging, distance-keeping, velocity-keeping, precise stopping, etc.) while providing short-term collision avoidance. The key to comfortable, human-like as well as physically feasible trajectories is the combined optimization of the lateral and longitudinal movements in street-relative coordinates with carefully chosen cost functionals and terminal state sets (manifolds). The performance of the approach is demonstrated in simulated traffic scenarios.},

	abstract = {In the context of trajectory planning for autonomous vehicles, a widely used vehicle model relies on linear integrator dynamics. We consider planning with this model type, with a focus on the requirement to account for curved road topologies. As our analysis reveals, this generally gives rise to non-convex, coupled constraints on the vehicle’s states and inputs, which impedes computationally efficient planning. We propose a method to resolve this issue by modification of the non-convex constraints. This modification is based on inner approximations of sub-level sets of nonlinear functions, which are obtained by quantifier elimination. The efficacy of the method is demonstrated in two example scenarios.},

	abstract = {Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition (CAD) has long been one of the most important algorithms within Symbolic Computation, as a tool to perform quantifier elimination in first order logic over the reals. More recently it is finding prominence in the Satisfiability Checking community, as a tool to identify satisfying solutions of problems in nonlinear real arithmetic. The original algorithm produces decompositions according to the signs of polynomials, when what is usually required is a decomposition according to the truth of a formula containing those polynomials. One approach to achieve that coarser (but hopefully cheaper) decomposition is to reduce the polynomials identified in the CAD to reflect a logical structure which reduces the solution space dimension: the presence of Equational Constraints (ECs). This paper may act as a tutorial for the use of CAD with ECs: we describe all necessary background and the current state of the art. In particular, we present recent work on how McCallum's theory of reduced projection may be leveraged to make further savings in the lifting phase: both to the polynomials we lift with and the cells lifted over. We give a new complexity analysis to demonstrate that the double exponent in the worst case complexity bound for CAD reduces in line with the number of ECs. We show that the reduction can apply to both the number of polynomials produced and their degree.},
