	abstract = {We describe a practical path-planning algorithm for an autonomous vehicle operating in an unknown semi-structured (or unstructured) environment, where obstacles are detected online by the robot’s sensors. This work was motivated by and experimentally validated in the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge, where robotic vehicles had to autonomously navigate parking lots. The core of our approach to path planning consists of two phases. The first phase uses a variant of A* search (applied to the 3D kinematic state space of the vehicle) to obtain a kinematically feasible trajectory. The second phase then improves the quality of the solution via numeric non-linear optimization, leading to a local (and frequently global) optimum. Further, we extend our algorithm to use prior topological knowledge of the environment to guide path planning, leading to faster search and final trajectories better suited to the structure of the environment. We present experimental results from the DARPA Urban Challenge, where our robot demonstrated near-flawless performance in complex general path-planning tasks such as navigating parking lots and executing U-turns on blocked roads. We also present results on autonomous navigation of real parking lots. In those latter tasks, which are significantly more complex than the ones in the DARPA Urban Challenge, the time of a full replanning cycle of our planner is in the range of 50—300 ms.},

	abstract = {We present an approach to the problem of differentially constrained mobile robot motion planning in arbitrary cost fields. The approach is based on deterministic search in a specially discretized state space. We compute a set of elementary motions that connects each discrete state value to a set of its reachable neighbors via feasible motions. Thus, this set of motions induces a connected search graph. The motions are carefully designed to terminate at discrete states, whose dimensions include relevant state variables (e.g., position, heading, curvature, and velocity). The discrete states, and thus the motions, repeat at regular intervals, forming a lattice. We ensure that all paths in the graph encode feasible motions via the imposition of continuity constraints on state variables at graph vertices and compliance of the graph edges with a differential equation comprising the vehicle model. The resulting state lattice permits fast full configuration space cost evaluation and collision detection. Experimental results with research prototype rovers demonstrate that the planner allows us to exploit the entire envelope of vehicle maneuverability in rough terrain, while featuring real-time performance. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Trajectory planning is a significant component of autonomous vehicle system, which directly influences the automated traffic safety. In this paper, the motion prediction of other traffic participants is considered. We use Monte Carlo simulation to predict the probabilistic occupancy of the object and give a map from probability statistics to actual scenarios. The non-time-based reference trajectory can be obtained by using high-definition map and lane detection. Then model predictive control is utilized to optimize the reference trajectory according to the current state of autonomous vehicle. Different prediction horizons and coordinate transformation are adopted to optimize the planning. By doing so, the constraint conditions can be easily involved and the result is more intuitive. The probabilistic occupancy of other traffic participants are computed offline and then the obtained results are used in real-time application. Therefore, the real-time computational burden is reduced. The crash probability is put forward to verify the feasibility of real-time trajectory in safety assessment module. Two typical scenarios are analyzed: lane change on the straight road and turning at the intersection. The simulation results illustrate the efficiency of our method.},

The historic Bertha Benz Memorial Route is particularly challenging for autonomous driving. The course taken by the autonomous vehicle had a length of 103 km and covered rural roads, 23 small villages and major cities (e.g. downtown Mannheim and Heidelberg). The route posed a large variety of difficult traffic scenarios including intersections with and without traffic lights, roundabouts, and narrow passages with oncoming traffic.

Recent advances in the field of perception, planning, and decision-making for autonomous vehicles have led to great improvements in functional capabilities, with several prototypes already driving on our roads and streets. Yet challenges remain regarding guaranteed performance and safety under all driving circumstances. For instance, planning methods that provide safe and system-compliant performance in complex, cluttered environments while modeling the uncertain interaction with other traffic participants are required. Furthermore, new paradigms, such as interactive planning and end-to-end learning, open up questions regarding safety and reliability that need to be addressed. In this survey, we emphasize recent approaches for integrated perception and planning and for behavior-aware planning, many of which rely on machine learning. This raises the question of verification and safety, which we also touch upon. Finally, we discuss the state of the art and remaining challenges for managing fleets of autonomous vehicles.},

Despite its perceived utility, it has not yet been successfully applied in automotive applications. Motivated by the successful demonstrations of learning of Atari games and Go by Google DeepMind, we propose a framework for autonomous driving using deep reinforcement learning. This is of particular relevance as it is difficult to pose autonomous driving as a supervised learning problem due to strong interactions with the environment including other vehicles, pedestrians and roadworks. As it is a relatively new area of research for autonomous driving, we provide a short overview of deep reinforcement learning and then describe our proposed framework. It incorporates Recurrent Neural Networks for information integration, enabling the car to handle partially observable scenarios. It also integrates the recent work on attention models to focus on relevant information, thereby reducing the computational complexity for deployment on embedded hardware. The framework was tested in an open source 3D car racing simulator called TORCS. Our simulation results demonstrate learning of autonomous maneuvering in a scenario of complex road curvatures and simple interaction of other vehicles.},

A cost function based on a combination of obstacle and smoothness cost is optimized in each iteration. No gradient information is required for the particular optimization algorithm that we use and so general costs for which derivatives may not be available (e.g. costs corresponding to constraints and motor torques) can be included in the cost function. We demonstrate the approach both in simulation and on a mobile manipulation system for unconstrained and constrained tasks.

	abstract = {—Traditionally, autonomous cars make predictions about other drivers’ future trajectories, and plan to stay out of their way. This tends to result in defensive and opaque behaviors. Our key insight is that an autonomous car’s actions will actually affect what other cars will do in response, whether the car is aware of it or not. Our thesis is that we can leverage these responses to plan more efﬁcient and communicative behaviors. We model the interaction between an autonomous car and a human driver as a dynamical system, in which the robot’s actions have immediate consequences on the state of the car, but also on human actions. We model these consequences by approximating the human as an optimal planner, with a reward function that we acquire through Inverse Reinforcement Learning. When the robot plans with this reward function in this dynamical system, it comes up with actions that purposefully change human state: it merges in front of a human to get them to slow down or to reach its own goal faster; it blocks two lanes to get them to switch to a third lane; or it backs up slightly at an intersection to get them to proceed ﬁrst. Such behaviors arise from the optimization, without relying on hand-coded signaling strategies and without ever explicitly modeling communication. Our user study results suggest that the robot is indeed capable of eliciting desired changes in human state by planning using this dynamical system.},

Considering surrounding vehicles, two types of uncertainties occur: multiple future maneuvers are possible, and within these maneuvers the vehicle can vary from the predicted ideal maneuver path. Focusing on only one of these uncertainties can either lead to neglecting potential risks or result in overly conservative motion planning. Here, we suggest a Stochastic Model Predictive Control strategy that tackles the possibility of multiple future maneuvers of surrounding vehicles, while also considering uncertainty within the execution of these predicted maneuvers. The proposed control method is a combination of Scenario Model Predictive Control to cope with multiple predicted maneuvers of other vehicles, and Stochastic Model Predictive Control using chance-constraints to take into account vehicle deviations from the predicted maneuver trajectories of the respective maneuver. Adjustable risk parameters permit a violation of safety constraints up to a desired probability, allowing a trade-off between risk and performance. A simulation of a two-lane scenario demonstrates the effectiveness of our method.},

To provide dynamically feasible trajectory planning for vehicles based on different control goals one has to deal with the trade-off between numerical resources and correctness. The first part of the paper presents a solution which uses classical optimization based approach that generates the expected results though on the expense of computational effort, which is not acceptable in real-time environment. Two hybrid approaches are introduced in the second part, where the optimization is replaced or aided with artificial neural networks (ANN), trained with the data generated off-line by the first planner. Results show that the solution highly decreases the running time of the algorithm, with almost the same level of performance.

This comparative review provides an up-to-date guide and reference manual for the use of sampling-based motion planning algorithms. It includes a history of motion planning, an overview of the most successful planners, and a discussion of their properties. It also shows how planners can handle special cases and how extensions of motion planning can be accommodated. To put sampling-based motion planning into a larger context, a discussion of alternative motion generation frameworks highlights their respective differences from sampling-based motion planning. Finally, a set of sampling-based motion planners are compared on 24 challenging planning problems in order to provide insights into which planners perform well in which situations and where future research would be required. This comparative review thereby provides not only a useful reference manual for researchers in the field but also a guide for practitioners to make informed algorithmic decisions.},

The challenge for autonomous vehicles is the requirement of operating accurately and robustly in the urban environment. This paper focuses on how to efficiently solve the hierarchical control system of a self-driving car into practice. This technique is composed of decision making, local path planning and control. An ego vehicle is navigated by global path planning with the aid of a High Definition map. Firstly, we propose the decision making for motion planning by applying a two-stage Finite State Machine to manipulate mission planning and control states. Furthermore, we implement a real-time hybrid A* algorithm with an occupancy grid map to find an efficient route for obstacle avoidance. Secondly, the local path planning is conducted to generate a safe and comfortable trajectory in unstructured scenarios. Herein, we solve an optimization problem with nonlinear constraints to optimize the sum of jerks for a smooth drive. In addition, controllers are designed by using the pure pursuit algorithm and the scheduled feedforward PI controller for lateral and longitudinal direction, respectively. The experimental results show that the proposed framework can operate efficiently in the urban scenario.},

We consider planning with this model type, with a focus on the requirement to account for curved road topologies. As our analysis reveals, this generally gives rise to non-convex, coupled constraints on the vehicle’s states and inputs, which impedes computationally efficient planning. We propose a method to resolve this issue by modification of the non-convex constraints. This modification is based on inner approximations of sub-level sets of nonlinear functions, which are obtained by quantifier elimination. The efficacy of the method is demonstrated in two example scenarios.},

	abstract = {Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition (CAD) has long been one of the most important algorithms within Symbolic Computation, as a tool to perform quantifier elimination in first order logic over the reals. More recently it is finding prominence in the Satisfiability Checking community, as a tool to identify satisfying solutions of problems in nonlinear real arithmetic. The original algorithm produces decompositions according to the signs of polynomials, when what is usually required is a decomposition according to the truth of a formula containing those polynomials. One approach to achieve that coarser (but hopefully cheaper) decomposition is to reduce the polynomials identified in the CAD to reflect a logical structure which reduces the solution space dimension: the presence of Equational Constraints (ECs). This paper may act as a tutorial for the use of CAD with ECs: we describe all necessary background and the current state of the art. In particular, we present recent work on how McCallum's theory of reduced projection may be leveraged to make further savings in the lifting phase: both to the polynomials we lift with and the cells lifted over. We give a new complexity analysis to demonstrate that the double exponent in the worst case complexity bound for CAD reduces in line with the number of ECs. We show that the reduction can apply to both the number of polynomials produced and their degree.},

	abstract = {In normal on-road situations, autonomous vehicles will be expected to have smooth trajectories with relatively little demand on the vehicle dynamics to ensure passenger comfort and driving safety. However, the occurrence of unexpected events may require vehicles to perform aggressive maneuvers, near the limits of their dynamic capacities. In order to ensure the occupant's safety in these situations, the ability to plan controllable but near-limits trajectories will be of very high importance. One of the main issues in planning aggressive maneuvers lies in the high complexity of the vehicle dynamics near the handling limits, which effectively makes state-of-the-art methods such as Model Predictive Control difficult to use. This article studies a highly precise model of the vehicle body to derive a simpler, constrained second-order integrator dynamic model which remains precise even near the handling limits of the vehicle. Preliminary simulation results indicate that our model provides better accuracy without increasing computation time compared to a more classical kinematic bicycle model. The proposed model can find applications for contingency planning, which may require aggressive maneuvers, or for trajectory planning at high speed, for instance in racing applications.},

To extend the capability of current advanced driver assistance systems, and eventually realize fully automated driving, the intelligent vehicle system must have the ability to plan different maneuvers while adapting to the surrounding traffic environment. This paper presents an algorithm for longitudinal and lateral trajectory planning for automated driving maneuvers where the vehicle does not have right of way, i.e., yielding maneuvers. Such maneuvers include, e.g., lane change, roundabout entry, and intersection crossing. In the proposed approach, the traffic environment which the vehicle must traverse is incorporated as constraints on its longitudinal and lateral positions. The trajectory planning problem can thereby be formulated as two loosely coupled low-complexity model predictive control problems for longitudinal and lateral motion. Simulation results demonstrate the ability of the proposed trajectory planning algorithm to generate smooth collision-free maneuvers which are appropriate for various traffic situations.},

The architecture is tested on a high-fidelity simulation model on a challenging track with small curve radius, with and without surrounding obstacles.},

	abstract = {Autonomous vehicles are rapidly advancing and have the potential to revolutionize transportation in the future. This paper primarily focuses on vehicle motion trajectory planning algorithms, examining the methods for estimating collision risks based on sensed environmental information and approaches for achieving user-aligned trajectory planning results. It investigates the different categories of planning algorithms within the scope of local trajectory planning applications for autonomous driving, discussing and differentiating their properties in detail through a review of the recent studies. The risk estimation methods are classified and introduced based on their descriptions of the sensed collision risks in traffic environments and their integration with trajectory planning algorithms. Additionally, various user experience-oriented methods, which utilize human data to enhance the trajectory planning performance and generate human-like trajectories, are explored. The paper provides comparative analyses of these algorithms and methods from different perspectives, revealing the interconnections between these topics. The current challenges and future prospects of the trajectory planning tasks in autonomous vehicles are also discussed.},

	abstract = {Mixed-Integer Quadratic Programming (MIQP) has been identified as a suitable approach for finding an optimal solution to the behavior planning problem with low runtimes. Logical constraints and continuous equations are optimized alongside. However, it has only been formulated for a straight road, omitting common situations such as taking turns at intersections. This has prevented the model from being used in reality so far. Based on a triple integrator model formulation, we compute the orientation of the vehicle and model it in a disjunctive manner. That allows us to formulate linear constraints to account for the non-holonomy and collision avoidance. These constraints are approximations, for which we introduce the theory. We show the applicability in two benchmark scenarios and prove the feasibility by solving the same models using nonlinear optimization. This new model will allow researchers to leverage the benefits of MIQP, such as logical constraints, or global optimality.},

This technology raises relevant controversies, especially with recent deadly accidents. Nevertheless, autonomous vehicles are still popular and attractive thanks to the improvement they represent to people's way of life (safer and quicker transit, more accessible, comfortable, convenient, efficient, and environment-friendly). This paper presents a review of motion planning techniques over the last decade with a focus on highway planning. In the context of this article, motion planning denotes path generation and decision making. Highway situations limit the problem to high speed and small curvature roads, with specific driver rules, under a constrained environment framework. Lane change, obstacle avoidance, car following, and merging are the situations addressed in this paper. After a brief introduction to the context of autonomous ground vehicles, the detailed conditions for motion planning are described. The main algorithms in motion planning, their features, and their applications to highway driving are reviewed, along with current and future challenges and open issues.},

	abstract = {Intelligent vehicles have increased their capabilities for highly and, even fully, automated driving under controlled environments. Scene information is received using onboard sensors and communication network systems, i.e., infrastructure and other vehicles. Considering the available information, different motion planning and control techniques have been implemented to autonomously driving on complex environments. The main goal is focused on executing strategies to improve safety, comfort, and energy optimization. However, research challenges such as navigation in urban dynamic environments with obstacle avoidance capabilities, i.e., vulnerable road users (VRU) and vehicles, and cooperative maneuvers among automated and semi-automated vehicles still need further efforts for a real environment implementation. This paper presents a review of motion planning techniques implemented in the intelligent vehicles literature. A description of the technique used by research teams, their contributions in motion planning, and a comparison among these techniques is also presented. Relevant works in the overtaking and obstacle avoidance maneuvers are presented, allowing the understanding of the gaps and challenges to be addressed in the next years. Finally, an overview of future research direction and applications is given.},

We extend a branching technique originally developed for MILP, reliability branching, to the MINLP case. Motivated by the demand for open-source solvers for real-world MINLP problems, we have developed an sBB software package named couenne (Convex Over- and Under-ENvelopes for Non-linear Estimation) and used it for extensive tests on several combinations of BT and branching techniques on a set of publicly available and real-world MINLP instances. We also compare the performance of couenne with a state-of-the-art MINLP solver.},
