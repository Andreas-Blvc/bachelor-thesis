This section addresses the problem of determining an inscribed polytope, as defined in Problem \ref{problem:inscribed_polytope}.
Our approach begins by simplifying the original constraint set through dimensionality reduction.

To achieve this, we decouple the state variables $s$, $n$, and $\dot{n}$, each of which is independently constrained within an interval:

\begin{align}
	\label{eq:state_constraints}
	\underline{s} \leq s \leq \overline{s},       \\
	\underline{n}(s) \leq n \leq \overline{n}(s), \\
	\underline{\dot{n}} \leq \dot{n} \leq \overline{\dot{n}}.
\end{align}

By ensuring that the remaining constraints hold for all values of $s$, $n$, and $\dot{n}$ within their respective intervals, we effectively reduce
the problem to a lower-dimensional space involving only the remaining variables.

We define the reduced constraint set, $\tilde{C}$, over the variables $\dot{s}$ and the artificial control inputs $\tilde{u}_{di}$ as follows:

\begin{equation}
	\tilde{C} =
	\left\{ \;
	\begin{bmatrix}
		\dot{s} \\
		u_t     \\
		u_n
	\end{bmatrix}
	\; \middle|\;
	\begin{bmatrix}
		\tilde{x}_{di} \\ \tilde{u}_{di}
	\end{bmatrix} \in \mathcal{C}, \quad \forall
	\begin{bmatrix}
		s \\
		n \\
		\dot{n}
	\end{bmatrix} \in
	\begin{bmatrix}
		\underline{s}, \overline{s} \\
		\underline{n}, \overline{n} \\
		\underline{\dot{n}}, \overline{\dot{n}}
	\end{bmatrix}
	\right\}.
\end{equation}

To make $\tilde{C}$ practically useful, we aim to express it as a set of linear inequalities.
Since quantifiers cannot be directly modeled according to the DCP rules, we need to eliminate them.

The task of expressing $\tilde{C}$ as linear inequalities can be framed as a problem of \textbf{quantifier elimination}, a common technique in
computer algebra.
The goal of quantifier elimination is to transform a formula containing quantified variables into an equivalent form without quantifiers.

In our case, the constraint set can be expressed as the quantified formula:

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:forall_formula}
	\phi :=
	\forall
	\begin{bmatrix}
		s \\
		n \\
		\dot{n}
	\end{bmatrix} \in
	\begin{bmatrix}
		\underline{s}, \overline{s} \\
		\underline{n}, \overline{n} \\
		\underline{\dot{n}}, \overline{\dot{n}}
	\end{bmatrix}: \quad
	\begin{aligned}
		 & \underline{v_x} \leq \dot{s}(1-nC(s)) \leq \overline{v_x} \quad \land                         \\
		 & \underline{\dot{\psi}} \leq C(s)\dot{s} \leq \overline{\dot{\psi}} \quad \land                \\
		 & \underline{a_{\psi}} \leq C'(s)\dot{s}^2 + C(s)u_t \leq \overline{a_{\psi}} \quad \land       \\
		 & \begin{bmatrix}
			   \underline{a_x} \\[2mm] \underline{a_y}
		   \end{bmatrix} \leq g(\tilde{x}_{di},\tilde{u}_{di}) \leq \begin{bmatrix}
			                                                            \overline{a_x} \\[2mm] \overline{a_y}
		                                                            \end{bmatrix} \quad \land \\
		 & \|g(\tilde{x}_{di}, \tilde{u}_{di})\|^2 \leq c.
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Typically, quantifier elimination seeks a formula $\phi'$ such that:

\[ \phi' \iff \phi \] where $\phi'$ contains no quantifiers.
However, in our case, we relax this requirement and allow $\phi'$ to be a sufficient condition for $\phi$, meaning:

\[ \phi'
	\implies \phi \]

This means that $\phi'$ describes a subset of $\tilde{C}$.
This relaxation has two advantages:

It enables more efficient algorithms for quantifier elimination, as we do not need an exact
equivalent formula, and it may be necessary, as $\tilde{C}$ is not guaranteed to be convex.

We propose two approaches to eliminate the quantifiers in $\phi$ and express $\tilde{C}$ as a set of linear inequalities.
The first approach involves interval fitting for the state variables and control inputs, and we will present the results to facilitate replication.
The second approach uses Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition (CAD) to eliminate the quantifiers.
Since CAD has multiple implementations and explaining this complex algorithm is beyond the scope of this work, we will only present the idea behind
it by demonstrating the algorithm on an example.
Finally, we will compare the results of both approaches and discuss their advantages and disadvantages.

Either approach will provide us with a polytope $\tilde{C}$, which we can use to define the solution to Problem:
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:pm_coupling_constraints}
	\hat{C} = \tilde{C} \times [\underline{s}, \overline{s}] \times [\underline{n}, \overline{n}] \times [\underline{\dot{n}}, \overline{\dot{n}}]
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Approach 1: Interval Fitting for State Variables and Control Inputs} \label{subsubsec:interval_fitting}
The idea of the first approach is to find intervals for the variables of interest, namely $\dot{s}$, $u_t$, and $u_n$, such that for any values these
variables may take within those intervals, the implications from \eqref{eq:forall_formula} hold.
Each condition of these implications follows a specific pattern.
Let $x \in \{\dot{s}, u_t, u_n\}$ and $y$ be a vector containing the remaining variables that are part of the condition.
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:cur_condition}
	c_{min} \leq f(x, y) \leq c_{max}
\end{equation}
where $x \in \mathbb{R}$, $y \in \mathbb{R}^n$, and $f: \mathbb{R}^{n+1} \to \mathbb{R}$, with constants $c_{min}, c_{max} \in \mathbb{R}$.
The variable $x$ is selected such that all other variables contained in $y$ are bounded.
Additionally, $x$ is chosen so that $f$ is affine in $x$, represented by:
\begin{equation}
	f(x, y) = a(y) x + b(y)
\end{equation}
where $a, b : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$. Since $a$ and $b$ are continuous functions over a bounded domain $Y$, we can find bounds on $a(y)$ and $b(y)$:
\begin{equation}
	a_{min} \leq a(y) \leq a_{max}, \quad b_{min} \leq b(y) \leq b_{max}
\end{equation}
Our goal is to find an interval $[\underline{x}, \overline{x}]$ for $x$ such that
\begin{equation}
	x\in [\underline{x}, \overline{x}] \implies \forall y\in Y: c_{min} \leq f(x, y) \leq c_{max}
\end{equation}

We define $X := [\underline{x}, \overline{x}]$.
To calculate $X$, we perform a case distinction based on the possible signs of $a(y)$.
Let's start with

\textbf{1.
}
$a(y) > 0$:
We can subtract \eqref{eq:cur_condition} with $b(y)$ and divide by $a(y)$:
\[
	\frac{c_{min}-b(y)}{a(y)} \leq x \leq \frac{c_{max}-b(y)}{a(y)}
\]
Since we have to ensure the condition holds even in the worst case, $X$ is given by:
\[
	\underline{x} =
	\begin{cases}
		\begin{array}{ll}
			\frac{c_{min}-b_{min}}{a_{max}}, & \text{if } c_{min}-b_{min} < 0 \\[10pt]
			\frac{c_{min}-b_{min}}{a_{min}}, & \text{otherwise}
		\end{array}
	\end{cases}
\]
\[
	\overline{x} =
	\begin{cases}
		\begin{array}{ll}
			\frac{c_{max}-b_{max}}{a_{min}}, & \text{if } c_{max}-b_{max} < 0 \\[10pt]
			\frac{c_{max}-b_{max}}{a_{max}}, & \text{otherwise}
		\end{array}
	\end{cases}
\]

\textbf{2.}
$a(y) \geq 0$:
Since $a(y) = 0$ for some $y\in Y$, we have to test if this condition holds:
\[
	c_{min} \leq b_{min} \text{ and } b_{max} \leq c_{max}
\]
If this condition does not hold, then $X=\emptyset$.
Otherwise, we exclude all $y \in Y$ for which $a(y)=0$ and proceed to the first case.

\textbf{3.}
$a(y) < 0$:
We can again subtract $b(y)$ from \eqref{eq:cur_condition} and divide by $a(y)$, but this time the direction of the inequalities changes:
\[
	\frac{c_{max}-b(y)}{a(y)} \leq x \leq \frac{c_{min}-b(y)}{a(y)}
\]
and by looking at the worst cases of the lower and upper bound, we can calculate $X$:
\[
	\underline{x} =
	\begin{cases}
		\begin{array}{ll}
			\frac{c_{max}-b_{max}}{a_{max}}, & \text{if } c_{max}-b_{max} < 0 \\[10pt]
			\frac{c_{max}-b_{max}}{a_{min}}, & \text{otherwise}
		\end{array}
	\end{cases}
\]
\[
	\overline{x} =
	\begin{cases}
		\begin{array}{ll}
			\frac{c_{min}-b_{min}}{a_{min}}, & \text{if } c_{min}-b_{min} < 0 \\[10pt]
			\frac{c_{min}-b_{min}}{a_{max}}, & \text{otherwise}
		\end{array}
	\end{cases}
\]

\textbf{4.}
$a(y) \leq 0$:
Similar to the second case, we need to check if $c_{min} \leq b_{min}$ and $b_{max} \leq c_{max}$ hold.
If not, set $X=\emptyset$.
Otherwise, ignore the values where $a(y)$ equals zero and proceed to the third case.

\textbf{5.}
We have so far considered all the cases where $a(y)$ cannot take both positive and negative values.
We now consider the last case, where $a_{min} < 0$ and $a_{max} > 0$.
Since $a(y) = 0$ for some values, we first check if $c_{min} \leq b_{min}$ and $b_{max} \leq c_{max}$.
If this condition does not hold, we set $X = \emptyset$.
Otherwise, $X$ is given by:

\[ \underline{x} = \max \left\{ \frac{c_{min} - b_{min}}{a_{max}}, \frac{c_{max} - b_{max}}{a_{min}}
	\right\} \]

\[ \overline{x} = \min \left\{ \frac{c_{max} - b_{max}}{a_{max}}, \frac{c_{min} - b_{min}}{a_{min}} \right\} \]

If we end up with $x_{max} < x_{min}$, set $X=\emptyset$.

All of this applies nicely to our scenario, as we can systematically apply these rules to each constraint step by step.
The resulting polytope, based on the interval approach, is box-shaped.
This shape further reduces our set of possible state variables and control inputs.

\subsubsection{Approach 2: Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition} \label{subsubsec:cad}

The second approach is to use Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition (CAD) to find the inscribed polytope.
This method is computationally more expensive but provides a more accurate result.
The idea is to find an equivalent formula without quantifiers for a given formula containing quantifiers.
This can be done using CAD.

CAD is a method used in computer algebra for solving systems of polynomial equations and inequalities.
Given a set of polynomial equations and inequalities, CAD decomposes the space into a finite number of cylindrical cells.
Each cell is described by a sequence of polynomial inequalities and has a constant truth value over the input set of polynomial equations and
inequalities.
This way, one only needs to pick one point from each cell to check the truth value of the input set.
The number of cells grows doubly exponentially with the number of variables in the input set.
Several implementations of CAD exist.

We will illustrate how the algorithm works, but it is beyond the scope of this work to explain the implementations in detail.
Instead, we provide a basic example to illustrate the algorithm without delving into the details.
You can find more information in the literature \cite{caviness_quantifier_1998, england_cylindrical_2020}.

\subsubsection{Example CAD}
To illustrate the process of eliminating $\forall$ quantifiers, consider the following problem:

\[ \forall x, x^2 + bx + 1 \geq 0
\]

Since quantifier elimination is typically performed on existential quantifiers, we first solve the problem for:

\[ \exists x, x^2 + bx + 1 < 0 \]

Once we have the solution for this problem, we can take the compliment over
$\mathbb{R}$ to obtain the solution for the original problem.
We start by applying CAD to the polynomial $x^2 + bx + 1$, which results in 7 cells, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:example_cells}.
Most of the cells are open, and if the edge of the cell is part of it, it is depicted with the same color but dashed.

		\end{axis}
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\caption{Illustrating the cells with shaded regions.}
	\label{fig:example_cells}
\end{figure}
We now need to check the truth value of the polynomial inequality $x^2 + bx + 1 < 0$ for each cell by picking a random sample and evaluating the
inequality.
The cells where the inequality holds true are colored in green and then projected onto the $b$-axis.
The resulting intervals are the solution to the existential quantifier elimination, which is $(-\infty, -2) \cup (2, \infty)$.
As an input to the algorithm, one must define an order of precedence for the variables.
In its first phase, the algorithm projects the space iteratively from $\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ until it reaches $\mathbb{R}^1$.
This is done by removing one of the remaining variables in each iteration, starting with the last in the order of precedence.
Therefore, if $b$ is defined as the first variable, the sets of polynomial inequalities for each cell will always contain an interval for $b$, which
corresponds to the projection on the axis.
This allows us to directly read the resulting intervals, which is shown in Figure \ref{fig:remaining_cells}.

\end{figure}
Since $(-\infty, -2) \cup (2, \infty)$ is the solution for $\exists x, x^2 + bx + 1 < 0$, the solution for the original problem is obtained by taking
the complement of this set:

\[ \forall x, x^2 + bx + 1 \geq 0 \iff b \in [-2, 2] \]

Using this technique for
eliminating quantifiers from formulas, we can apply it to find an inscribed polytope.

\subsubsection{Comparison of Interval Fitting and CAD Approaches}

In our benchmarks, the first approach, despite its simplicity, performed remarkably well.
We used the following parameters for the benchmarks:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $C(s) \in \left[-\frac{1}{200}, 0\right]$, $s \in [0, 10]$, $n \in [0, 2]$
	\item $v_x \in [0, 10]$, $v_y \in [-2, 2]$, $a_x \in [-3, 6]$, $a_y \in [-4, 4]$
	\item $\dot{\psi} \in [-5, 5]$, $a_\psi \in [-2, 2]$
\end{itemize}

The results are shown in the following Figure \ref{fig:qe-comparison}.

\end{figure}

In conclusion, eliminating the quantifiers with the first approach leads to a near-optimal result, comparable to the one achieved using the second
approach with CAD.
However, using CAD has a significant downside that we have not yet mentioned.
It is not guaranteed that the resulting formula is convex.
Typically, you will encounter disjunctions of polynomial inequalities, which cannot be handled by a convex solver without resorting to integer
programming or an equivalent approach.
It is also not guaranteed that each polynomial inequality follows the DCP rules, even if the set described by the resulting formula is convex.
Additional techniques would be required to use the second approach for our planner.

In cases where the resulting set is convex, we used a sampling approach to obtain an inner approximation described by half-spaces.
This results in a sequence of linear constraints that all must be satisfied, thus losing a small proportion of the original set.
Consequently, the difference between our first approach and the second approach becomes even smaller.
Additionally, we end up with double or triple the number of constraints on each state variable and each control input, which may lead to slower
solver times.

Overall, while the CAD approach provides a more accurate result, the first approach offers a good balance between computational efficiency and
accuracy, making it a viable option for practical applications.

\subsubsection{Limitations and Outlook}\label{subsubsec:limitations_and_outlook}

While the $\forall$-elimination approach provides a computationally efficient method to find intervals for the variables of interest, it can be quite restrictive for several reasons:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Conservativeness:}
	      The approach tends to be conservative because it ensures that the constraints hold for all possible values within the intervals.
	      This often leads to smaller intervals, which may exclude feasible solutions that could be considered by less conservative methods.
	\item \textbf{Dependence on Affine Functions:}
	      The first method relies on the assumption that the function $f(x, y)$ is affine in $x$ and all variables in $y$ are bounded.
	      If this assumption does not hold, the approach may not be applicable.
\end{itemize}

Overall, while the $\forall$-elimination approach is useful for its simplicity and computational efficiency, it may lead to overly restrictive
solutions that do not fully exploit the feasible region.

Consider a scenario with a tight turn followed by a long straight road.
In such cases, the model will restrict $\dot{s}$ to an interval that is valid for both the tight turn and the straight road.
Consequently, the model will find a solution, but it will not be able to drive fast on the straight road, even though it is possible to drive faster
on the straight road than on the tight turn.

To address this issue, we can introduce segments of the road, one for the straight road and one for the tight turn.
We can independently construct the coupling constraints set for each segment.
However, this introduces a new problem: how to switch between the segments.
Our solution involves using the current vehicle velocity to predict when the vehicle will reach the end of the segment.
Knowing the vehicle's current position, velocity, and the distance to the end of the segment, we can calculate the time it will take to reach the
end.

Further, both approaches do not consider the possibility of achieving a larger feasible set by restricting $\dot{n}$ to a smaller interval.
The first approach handles the problem by using the bounds on $s$, $n$, and $\dot{n}$ to find the intervals for $\dot{s}$, which are then used for
$u_t$ and finally for $u_n$.
However, changing the order may lead to better results for desired driving behavior.

Given the simplicity of the first approach, we implemented a non-linear program that defines the relationships between the intervals with variables
as upper and lower bounds.
By adding constraints, we can define an objective that models certain driving behaviors.
For example, one might want to be able to slow down as quickly as possible or maximize the upper speed limit.
The latter objective leads to the following intervals:

	\caption{Comparison of two sets of intervals for state variables and control inputs.}

As you can see, the intervals on the right are preferable, as they only slightly reduce longitudinal acceleration while allowing for higher speeds.

In conclusion, we have successfully developed our first vehicle model for motion planning that can be solved using a convex solver.
Next, we will introduce a transformation that maps the state variables and control inputs of the planning model to a steering angle, which can be
used to control a vehicle based on the equations from \cite{eilbrecht_challenges_2020}.
A similar approach is demonstrated in \cite{werling_optimal_2010}, which served as an additional inspiration.
