\section{Performance Evaluation} \label{sec:performance-evaluation}

\subsection{Objectives} \label{subsec:objectives}

Our trajectory planner aims to minimize a cost function that represents the driving behavior we desire.
The cost function is composed of several objectives, each weighted by a corresponding factor.

The primary objectives considered are control effort, deviation from the reference trajectory, and terminal state accuracy.
The control effort objective aims to minimize
the numerical derivatives of control inputs to ensure smooth driving, represented by the cost function:
\begin{equation}
	J_{control} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \left\| d_1(t_i) \right\|^2
\end{equation}
where $d_1(t_i)\in \mathbb{R}^{dim(u)}$ is an auxiliary variable constrained by: \[
	d_1(t_i) = \frac{u(t_i) - u(t_{i-1})}{t_i - t_{i-1}}
\]

The tracking objective aims to minimize the deviation from the center of the road, represented by the cost function:
\begin{equation}
	J_{tracking} = \sum_{i=0}^{n} d_2(t_i)^2 \end{equation} where $d_2(t_i)\in \mathbb{R}$ is an auxiliary variable representing the negative distance to
the closest boundary, constrained by: \[ \max \left\{ n(t_i)-\overline{n}(s(t_i)), \underline{n}(s(t_i)) - n(t_i) \right\} \leq d_2(t_i)\] By
minimizing $J_{tracking}$, we maximize the distance to the road boundaries, which is optimal when the vehicle is centered on the road.

The terminal state objective aims to minimize the deviation from a desired terminal state $x_{final}$ at the final time step $t_n$, represented by the cost function:
\begin{equation}
	J_{terminal} = \|x(t_n) - x_{final}\|^2
\end{equation}

The total cost function $J$ is a weighted sum of these objectives:
\begin{equation}
	J = \alpha J_{control} + \beta J_{tracking} + \gamma J_{terminal} \label{eq:cost_function_combined} \end{equation} where $\alpha$, $\beta$, and
$\gamma$ are the weights that determine the relative importance of each objective.
By minimizing this cost function, our trajectory planner generates a trajectory that balances control effort, tracking the reference trajectory, and
accuracy in reaching the desired terminal state.

Since some of our objectives, such as $J_{tracking}$, involve nonlinear or nonconvex formulations, directly incorporating them into the optimization
problem can be challenging.
To address this, we introduce auxiliary variables that allow us to reformulate certain objectives into convex, computationally efficient expressions.
These auxiliary variables help model constraints and cost functions in a way that preserves convexity while maintaining the intended optimization
behavior.

\subsubsection{Auxiliary Variables}

Auxiliary variables can be used for modeling in many ways.
In our models we are the defining the road with as a function over $s$ the distance along the road.
One common part objective may be to minimize the offset to the center of the road.
The first formulation that may come to mind is: \[ \min g(x, u) + \left( n - \frac{\overline{n}(s) - \underline{n}(s)}{2} \right)^2 \] This is a
valid formulation, but it is not convex.
Instead, we are using different approach to formulate the offset to the center of the road.
\[
	\max \left\{ n - \overline{n}(s),  \underline{n}(s) - n \right\}
\]
which gives us the negative distance to the closer boundary of the road.
This formulation is convex, if $\overline{n}(s)$ is concave and $\underline{n}(s)$ is convex.
By introducing the auxiliary variable $d$ which is constrained by: \[ \max \left\{ n - \overline{n}(s), \underline{n}(s) - n \right\} \leq d \] we
can reformulate the objective as: \[ \min g(x, u) + d^2 \] This formulation is convex and can be solved efficiently.

To visualize these formulations, we can plot them using a constant value for \(\overline{n}(s)\) and \(\underline{n}(s)\) in Figure
\ref{fig:auxiliary_variables}.
Let's assume \(\overline{n}(s) = 5\) and \(\underline{n}(s) = 1\).

\end{figure}

While \(\max(x-5, 1-x)\) is a convex function, it is piecewise linear, which can lead to difficulties in optimization.
The benefit of using an auxiliary variable in this context is that it allows us to transform a piecewise linear and potentially non-differentiable
objective function into a smooth and differentiable convex function.
This transformation simplifies the optimization process, making it more efficient and reliable.
Specifically, by introducing the auxiliary variable \( d \) and reformulating the objective as \(\min g(x, u) + d^2\), we obtain a function that is
easier to handle with gradient-based optimization algorithms, which rely on smoothness and differentiability to find optimal solutions effectively.

\subsection{Scenarios} \label{subsec:scenarios}

In order to evaluate the performance of our trajectory planner, we implemented several driving scenarios.
These scenarios are designed to test different aspects of the planner's capabilities.
The Straight Road scenario evaluates the planner's ability to maintain a straight path with minimal control effort, ensuring smooth and efficient
driving.
In the Left Turn scenario, the planner's performance is assessed based on its ability to execute a smooth left turn while adhering to the reference
trajectory.
The Lane Change scenario tests the planner's capability to perform a lane change maneuver safely and efficiently, highlighting its responsiveness and
precision.
The Slalom scenario challenges the planner to navigate through a series of closely spaced obstacles, requiring precise control and smooth transitions
between maneuvers.
The Elchtest, also known as the moose test, evaluates the planner's ability to perform a sudden evasive maneuver to avoid an obstacle, testing its
quick decision-making and control under pressure.
The Elchtest scenario can be visualized as follows:
\begin{figure}[H]

		\node at (12,0) {End};
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\caption{Elchtest scenario visualization}
	\label{fig:elchtest}
\end{figure}

Finally, the Sharp U Turn scenario tests the planner's ability to execute a sharp U-turn, challenging its control effort and adherence to the desired
terminal state.

By evaluating the planner in these diverse scenarios, we can gain a comprehensive understanding of its strengths and areas for improvement.

Each segment is characterized by its length, curvature, and lane width at the start and end points.
This detailed breakdown helps in understanding the specific challenges posed by each scenario and how the trajectory planner adapts to different road
conditions.

\subsection{Simulation Setup} \label{subsec:simulation}

For the vehicle simulation, we employ a more sophisticated model from \cite{noauthor_dateien_2021} and discretize its dynamics using the Runge-Kutta
method \cite{griffiths_rungekutta_2010}, which offers greater accuracy compared to the forward Euler method used for trajectory planning.
To ensure reproducibility, we define the model using the following state variables and control inputs: \[ x = [p_x, p_y, \delta, v, \psi, \dot{\psi},
	\beta]^T, u = [a_x, v_{\delta}]^T \] where $p_x$, $p_y$ represent the vehicle's position coordinates, $\delta$ is the steering angle, $v$ is the
velocity, $\psi$ is the yaw angle, $\dot{\psi}$ is the yaw rate, $\beta$ is the slip angle, $a_x$ is the longitudinal acceleration, and $v_\delta$ is
the steering rate.

The model's dynamics are governed by the following equations, valid for $|v|\geq0.1$:
\[
	f(x, u) = \begin{bmatrix}
		v\cos(\psi + \beta)                                  \\
		v\sin(\psi + \beta)                                  \\
		v_\delta                                             \\
		a_x                                                  \\
		\dot{\psi}                                           \\
		\frac{\mu\,m}{I_{z}(l_{r}+l_{f})}\Bigl(
		l_{f}\,C_{S,f}\bigl(g\,l_{r}-a_xh_{cg}\bigr)\,\delta \\
		\;+                                                 \;\bigl[l_{r}\,C_{S,r}\bigl(g\,l_{f}+a_xh_{cg}\bigr)
			\;-\;l_{f}\,C_{S,f}\bigl(g\,l_{r}-a_xh_{cg}\bigr)\bigr]\,\beta
		\Bigr)                                               \\
		\quad -\;\Bigl[
		l_{f}^{2}\,C_{S,f}\bigl(g\,l_{r}-a_xh_{cg}\bigr)
		\;+\;
		l_{r}^{2}\,C_{S,r}\bigl(g\,l_{f}+a_xh_{cg}\bigr)
		\Bigr]
		\frac{\dot{\psi}}{v}                                 \\
		\frac{\mu}{v\,\bigl(l_{r}+l_{f}\bigr)}\Bigl(
		C_{S,f}\bigl(g\,l_{r}-a_xh_{cg}\bigr)\,\delta
		\;-\;
		\bigl[C_{S,r}\bigl(g\,l_{f}+a_xh_{cg}\bigr)          \\
			\;+\;
		C_{S,f}\bigl(g\,l_{r}-a_xh_{cg}\bigr)\bigr]\,\beta   \\
		\quad +\;\bigl[
			C_{S,r}\bigl(g\,l_{f}+a_xh_{cg}\bigr)\,l_{r}
			\;-\;
			C_{S,f}\bigl(g\,l_{r}-a_xh_{cg}\bigr)\,l_{f}
			\bigr]
		\frac{\dot{\psi}}{v}
		\Bigr)
		\;-\;
		\dot{\psi}
	\end{bmatrix}
\]
For smaller velocities $|v|<0.1$, the dynamics simplify to:
\[
	f(x, u) = \begin{bmatrix}
		v\cos(\psi + \beta) \\
		v\sin(\psi + \beta) \\
		v_\delta            \\
		a_x                 \\
		\dot{\psi}          \\
		\frac{1}{l_{wb}}
		\biggl(
		a_x\,\cos( \beta)\,\tan(\delta)
		\;-\;
		v\,\sin( \beta)\,\tan(\delta)\,\dot{x}_{7}
		\;+\;
		\frac{v\,\cos( \beta)}{\cos^2(\delta)}\,
		v_{\delta}
		\biggr)
		\\
		\frac{1}{1 +
			\bigl(\tan(\delta)\tfrac{l_{r}}{l_{wb}}\bigr)^2}
		\;\cdot\;
		\frac{l_{r}}{l_{wb}\,\cos^2(\delta)}\,
		v_{\delta}
	\end{bmatrix}
\]

We consider a vehicle, with the identifier '1' from \cite{noauthor_dateien_2021} of length \(l = 4.298\,\mathrm{m}\) and width \(w =
1.674\,\mathrm{m}\), with total mass \(m = 1.225\times10^3\,\mathrm{kg}\) and moment of inertia \(I_z = 1.538\times10^3\,\mathrm{kg\,m}^2\).
The center of gravity is located \(l_f = 0.883\,\mathrm{m}\) from the front axle and \(l_r = 1.508\,\mathrm{m}\) from the rear axle, at a height
\(h_{cg} = 0.557\,\mathrm{m}\).
The front and rear cornering stiffness coefficients are both \(C_{S,f} = C_{S,r} = 20.89\,\text{[1/rad]}\), and the friction coefficient is \(\mu =
1.048\).
The switching velocity for the dynamics is set to \(v_S = 4.755\,\mathrm{m/s}\).

\subsection{Results}
\label{subsec:results}

Throughout our simulations, we defined specific ranges for the control inputs to ensure realistic vehicle behavior.
The longitudinal acceleration, $a_x$, was constrained within $[-6, 3]$ m/s², while the steering rate, $v_\delta$, was limited to $[-0.5, 0.5]$ rad/s.
Additionally, the steering angle, $\delta$, was bounded within $[-0.698, 0.698]$ radians.
\[
	a_x \in [-6, 3] \text{ m/s²}, \quad v_\delta \in [-0.5, 0.5] \text{ rad/s}, \quad \delta \in [-0.698, 0.698] \text{ rad}
\]
To evaluate performance under different conditions, we simulated all scenarios at three distinct speeds:
\[
	v_{low}=5 \text{m/s}, v_{mid}=10 \text{m/s}, \text{and } v_{high}=20 \text{m/s}.
\]
We also allowed the vehicle to decelerate down to $70\%$ of its initial speed.

For time discretization, we implemented two configurations, represented as \[ t_{\text{conf}} = (T, R, \Delta t, \Delta^2 t_{\text{replan}}) \] where
$T$ is the time horizon, $R$ is the replanning interval, the initial constant time interval $\Delta t$ for the first few time points, and the
increasing time interval $\Delta^2 t_{\text{replan}}$ for the remaining time points as illustrated in \ref{fig:time_points}.
The first configuration, $t_{\text{conf}}^{(1)}$, was set to a smaller time horizon with a finer $\Delta t$, while the second configuration,
$t_{\text{conf}}^{(2)}$, used a larger time horizon with a coarser $\Delta t$ as well as a smaller slope for the time steps after the replanning
interval, providing two distinct approaches for evaluating planning and control strategies.
\begin{align*}
	t_{\text{conf}}^{(1)} = (3\text{s}, 0.1\text{s}, 10\text{ms}, 40\text{ms}) \\
	t_{\text{conf}}^{(2)} = (5\text{s}, 0.1\text{s}, 20\text{ms}, 20\text{ms})
\end{align*}

We used four objectives to evaluate performance: the control effort cost $J_{control}$, the trajectory tracking cost $J_{tracking}$, the terminal
cost $J_{terminal}$, and the combined cost function $J$ from \eqref{eq:cost_function_combined}, with weighting factors $\alpha = 1$, $\beta = 10^3$,
and $\gamma = 10^4$.
Those weights were chosen to equally balance the objectives.
\[
	J_{control}, J_{tracking}, J_{terminal}, J
\]

All simulations were conducted on a MacBook Air equipped with an Apple M1 processor and 16 GB of unified memory.
The operating system used was macOS 15.3 (24D60).
The simulations were executed using Python 3.11.3, compiled with Clang 13.0.0.

\subsubsection{Solver Times}

This section evaluates solver performance across different models and configurations.
We assessed efficiency by running simulations with varying velocity, scenarios, and objective functions, totaling $96$ simulations per
model-configuration pair.

Table \ref{tab:solver_performance} summarizes the average solver time and its deviation for each model and configuration.

\begin{table}[h]
	\centering
	\caption{Solver Performance for Different Models and Configurations}
	\label{tab:solver_performance}
	\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
		\toprule
		\textbf{Model}    & \textbf{Configuration}  & \textbf{Avg Time (ms)} & \textbf{Time Deviation (ms)} \\

		Double Integrator & $t_{\text{conf}}^{(1)}$ & 3.9                    & 1.0                          \\
		Double Integrator & $t_{\text{conf}}^{(2)}$ & 3.8                    & 1.3                          \\
		Bicycle           & $t_{\text{conf}}^{(1)}$ & 9.5                    & 2.1                          \\
		Bicycle           & $t_{\text{conf}}^{(2)}$ & 9.4                    & 2.9                          \\
		\bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The double integrator model outperforms the bicycle model, achieving solver times of $3.9$ms and $3.8$ms across both configurations.
In contrast, the bicycle model requires $9.5$ms and $9.4$ms, making it over twice as slow.
Solver time deviations also differ significantly: the double integrator model exhibits deviations of $1.0$ms and $1.3$ms, while the bicycle model
experiences deviations of $2.1$ms and $2.9$ms.

This indicates that the double integrator model provides not only faster solutions but also more stable performance.

Figures \ref{fig:slalom_point_mass_model} and \ref{fig:slalom_bicycle_model} illustrate solver performance in the Slalom scenario.
\begin{itemize}
	\item The double integrator model maintains relatively stable solver times across iterations.
	\item The bicycle model exhibits more variation, aligning with the larger solver time deviations observed in Table \ref{tab:solver_performance}.
\end{itemize}

These findings confirm that the double integrator model provides a more consistent and efficient solution.

\subsubsection{Completion Rates}

Figure \ref{fig:failed_scenarios} presents the number of failed scenarios per model.
As expected, both models fail every test in the Infeasible Curve scenario, which is intentionally designed to be unsolvable.
However, when the curve radius increases slightly (making the scenario marginally feasible), both models successfully complete it at the lowest
velocity $v_{\text{low}}$.

\end{figure}

The results indicate that higher speeds lead to higher failure rates.
However, an anomaly occurs in the Straight scenario, where the bicycle model has a higher failure rate at lower velocities.
This issue arises when using the $J_{\text{terminal}}$ objective function, which prioritizes velocity maximization.
This suggests a numerical instability that may be resolved using soft constraints.

The bicycle model completes more runs in the slalom scenario compared to the double integrator model.
This is because the double integrator model considers the worst-case scenario and does not find a solution if it is infeasible to drive on the inner
side of the curve, even though it might be feasible to drive on the outer line.
For example driving at the highest speed $v_{max}$, the resulting polytope of the double integrator model is empty.
Limiting the vehicle options to the outer side and reduce the upper speed limit to $14.5$m/s results in a non-empty set.
In fact, we can observe that the bicycle model completes the slalom always at the outer lines (see \ref{fig:slalom_bicycle_model_n}), while driving
at around $14.5$m/s (see \ref{fig:slalom_bicycle_model_velocity}).

\end{figure}

Overall, the kinematic bicycle model exhibits a higher failure rate, particularly in the Elchtest and Lane Change scenarios at high speeds (see
Figure \ref{fig:failed_scenarios_stacked}), where sharp turns are necessary.
This is primarily due to the limitations imposed by the friction circle approximation, which the model struggles to handle effectively.
In contrast, the double integrator model performs better in these scenarios as it does not depend on the friction circle approximation.
The double integrator model incorporates this constraint statically, whereas the dynamic approach of the bicycle model allows it to choose between
higher speeds with reduced steering capability or lower speeds with increased steering capability.
Further investigation into this behavior is warranted.

\subsubsection{Friction	circle}
We can calculate the constraints on the steering angle for $v_{high}$, resulting in a steering angle range of $\delta \in \emptyset$, while the exact
range for the model is $\delta \in [-0.07, 0.07]$.
For $v_{mid}$, the exact range is $\delta \in [-0.26, 0.26]$, whereas the approximated range is $\delta \in [-0.21, 0.21]$.
Without considering the friction circle, the model completes more simulations but violates the friction circle constraints.
This makes high-speed maneuvers infeasible for the bicycle model, as the friction circle approximation is too restrictive to accommodate the required
steering angles.

Using $J_{terminal}$, the model tries to maximize its velocity, exacerbating the problem since it does not slow down to achieve a higher steering
angle range.
This issue can be mitigated by introducing soft constraints, but the model will still attempt to keep the steering angle as low as possible.
In the left turn scenario, this results in a decreasing lateral offset.
Combined with the small angle approximation inaccuracies and ignoring forces during planning, the vehicle ends up hitting the right boundary of the
road.

To address this, we introduce a default constraint with an additional auxiliary variable $d_3$: \[ \min \left\{ \overline{n}(s(t_i)) - n(t_i), n(t_i)
	- \underline{n}(s(t_i)) \right\} \geq c - d_3 \] where $c$ is a constant modeling the desired distance to the road boundary, and $d_3 \geq 0$
converts the constraint into a soft constraint.
This way, the model can still try to minimize the cost function but must pay a penalty for getting too close to the road boundary.

	}
	\caption{Predictive model states for lane change using bicycle model}
	\label{fig:left_turn_bicycle_model}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{fig:left_turn_bicycle_model} shows this behavior, where we added the soft constraint to the left turn scenario, with $c=0.5$.

In summary, our evaluation demonstrates that while the double integrator model consistently provides fast, stable solutions, the kinematic bicycle
model—offering a more realistic depiction of vehicle dynamics—remains sensitive to challenging scenarios, particularly in sharp turns and high-speed
maneuvers.
These results reveal that improvements are still needed for the bicycle model, especially in terms of robust constraint handling and enhanced convex
reformulations.
Refining these aspects will be crucial for fully leveraging the higher fidelity of the bicycle model in real-world autonomous driving applications.
