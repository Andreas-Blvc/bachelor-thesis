% \section{Challenges and Limitations}

% This section discusses the various challenges encountered during the development and implementation of the control and planning algorithms for the
% vehicle.
% It highlights specific issues related to replanning, dynamics lag, and the application of McCormick relaxations.
% Each subsection provides a detailed explanation of the problem, the approach taken to address it, and the results obtained.
% The purpose of this section is to provide insight into the practical difficulties faced, and the solutions devised to overcome them, thereby
% contributing to the overall understanding and improvement of the system's performance.

% \subsection{Replanning Challenges for the Double Integrator Model}

% During the replanning phase for the double integrator model, we encountered a significant challenge.
% Our control layer introduced some inaccuracies, resulting in the vehicle reaching a higher velocity than anticipated at the time of replanning.
% This discrepancy led to infeasibility issues during the replanning process.

% To address this problem, we introduced soft constraints.
% These soft constraints allowed for a more flexible approach to handling the velocity overshoot, ensuring that the replanning process could still
% generate feasible trajectories despite the initial inaccuracies.
% By incorporating these soft constraints, we were able to mitigate the impact of the velocity overshoot and maintain the overall feasibility of the
% replanning process.

% \subsection{Lag in Dynamics}
% We experienced a lag caused by using the forward Euler method on the vehicle model's dynamics and adding a feedback loop to adjust the vehicle
% orientation.
% The issue arose because a change in the steering was accounted for in the orientation two additional steps later, leading to overcorrection and
% resulting in oscillation, illustrated by Figure \ref{fig:lag_orientation}.

% \end{figure}

% To address this problem, we employed a better discretization scheme and accounted for the lag in the feedback loop.
% By doing so, we were able to mitigate the overcorrection and eliminate the oscillation, leading to a more stable and accurate control of the
% vehicle's orientation.
