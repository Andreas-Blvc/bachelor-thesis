In this chapter, we evaluate the performance of our proposed method using a set of benchmark problems.
We introduced two models, $M_{pm}$ \eqref{model:point_mass} and $M_{kst}$ \eqref{model:kst}, each defined by its own dynamic equations and
constraints on state variables and control inputs.

To enable realistic driving tests, we must address key implementation details, which we will discuss next.
Additionally, a simulation model is required to assess the performance of the planned trajectory.
This simulation allows us to recreate real-world driving scenarios
and evaluate our models under practical conditions
