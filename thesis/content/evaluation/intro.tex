In this chapter, we evaluate the performance of our proposed method on a set of benchmark problems.
We introduced two models, $M_{pm}$ \eqref{model:point_mass} and $M_{kst}$ \eqref{model:kst}, each defined by its own set of dynamic equations and
constraints on state variables and control inputs.
To ensure realistic driving tests, we must address several key implementation details, which we discuss next.
Additionally, a simulation model is required to evaluate the planned trajectories under practical conditions.
This setup enables us to emulate real-world driving scenarios and assess how well our models perform in practice.
