In this chapter, we evaluate the performance of our proposed method on a set of benchmark problems.
We introduced two models, each with its own dynamic equations and coupling constraints on state variables and control inputs.
For the Point Mass Model, the dynamics are given by \ref{eq:pm_final_dynamics} and its coupling constraints by \ref{eq:pm_coupling_constraints},
which can be constructed using the two proposed methods for eliminating the for-all operator.
The dynamics of the kinematic single track model are approximated by \ref{eq:kst_final_dynamics}, and the coupling constraints are listed in section
\ref{sec:kst_coupling_constraints}.

For realistic driving tests, we still need to address implementation details, which we will handle next.
Additionally, we require a simulation model and a control layer implementation to map the planned trajectory to the vehicle.
The simulation model is used to evaluate the performance of the planned trajectory, while the control layer maps the planned trajectory to the
vehicle.
This allows us to construct actual scenarios and test our models in driving conditions.
