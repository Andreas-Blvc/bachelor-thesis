\chapter{Literature Review} \label{ch:lit_review}

To find relevant works, you should follow this guideline:
\begin{itemize}
\item Important catalogues: IEEE XPlore, Google scholar, Scopus, Web of Science, Research Gate
\item Start searching catalogues: Write down used keywords and used catalogues to avoid repeating a search; try some searches with the keyword ``survey'' or ``overview'' to find survey papers
\item Group results: Find categories in which to put your found papers
\item Rank papers in each category: consider reputation of journal/conference, reputation of authors, and citations 
\item In best ranked papers: Look into their literature lists; what other papers are relevant (do this iteratively)? Newer papers are more useful since they cover the literture up to a later point in time. Finding a great and recent survey paper is the jackpot
\item Once the search has converged: identify the most important groups
\item Visit websites of important groups to identify missed papers
\end{itemize}
