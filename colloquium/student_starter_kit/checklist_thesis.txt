Title: 
- Not too long
- Use important keywords
- Content should be obvious from title

Abstract:
- no math formulas, no references; only plain text.
- motivate topic
- mention novelty
- basic description of solution
- mention experiment if any made

Introduction:
- more detailed motivation of the work compared to the abstract
- literature overview
- relation to previous work
- novelty and improvement compared to previous work
- organization/structure of the thesis
- Make sure that you specify what your thesis assumes, such that reviewers cannot say that certain aspects are missing.

Results (includes description of your approach):
- rigorously check the validity/correctness of your results
- motivate each step of the proposed approach
- all statements have to be backed by one of the following: proof, reference, simulation, argumentation.
- validate results by numerical experiments
- are all variables introduced?
- are all required definitions made?
- are the results described such that one could implement your approach and replicate the experimental results?

Conclusions:
- What is the approach good for?
- Why is it better than existing work? Or: in what cases is it better than existing work?
- Does you approach have a unique feature?
- How close is the approach to be applied in practice? Possibly: mention highlights of experimental results.
- What are weak points, what is considered in future work?

Figures:
- do not put too much content in a figure
- label all objects (including axis)
- use large enough font size

Citations:
- Only cite papers that you have actually (partially) read.
- If a result has been previously obtained, you have to cite it.
- A reference always has title, author names, pages, year, conference/journal/book name; and for journals, volume and nr.
- A citation can be used to avoid proving results.
- Avoid citing very similar papers of the same author.
- Try to not forget important researchers in your field.
- Prefer journal articles over conference article and highly ranked journals over less ranked ones, except the paper to cite is essential.
- When citing books, be precise about the page or section you refer to since books are typically large; use \cite[pageNumber/section]{reference}.
- Websites are not citable. Use footnotes for URLs.

General:
- each sentence should have a purpose
- avoid using 'fill words'
- guide reader through the sections
- try to use simple language if possible
- present tense is used in scientific texts
- use proper set builder notation: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set-builder_notation
- each paragraph should have a specific message/purpose; think about a proper separation into paragraphs.
- a paragraph should consist of at least two sentences.
